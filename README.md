# WHY THIS PROJECT, WHY FASTAPI

I'm quite proficeint using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to develop server-side web applications but Django is a very robust, opinonated, battries included framework and sometime I don't really need them batteries ðŸª«. I just want to spin up a simple server in python, make it do something and get out, basically I wanted [Express](https://expressjs.com/) in Python.

With that in mind paired with my interset in the ecosystem, I decided to go with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and what better way is there to learn a framework than to build something with it.

I also chose to use FastAPI for a school project, soo...yeah.

_**If you see something you dont like close your eyes:**_ This might not be the best FastAPI project you find, it's my first ride with the framework and like 70% of the third party packages used.
